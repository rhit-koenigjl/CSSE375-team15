Write an encouraging message, no longer than 50 characters, that is something you would like to hear if you are a cute ghost version of Indiana Jones avoiding other ghosts and collecting coins. Make them as punny as possible. Include ghost, money bag, and sparkle emojis if relevant to the message. Keep them relatively appropriate and do not use quotation marks!
